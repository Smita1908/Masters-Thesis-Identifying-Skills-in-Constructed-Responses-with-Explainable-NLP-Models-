##  Tasks:

- Data Analysis folder contains  two jupyter files.
    - AFLEK_Data_Analysis.ipynb contains the details of the descriptive statistics for the AFLEK dataset.
    - CREG_Data_Analysis.ipynb contains the details of the descriptive statictics for the CREG-TUE dataset.

- Descriptive accuracy folder contains three jupyter file.
  - Explainability_Analyzing_Data.ipynb, Explainability_Constructing_Explanations.ipynb contain the local and global explainability of these two skills respectively. Also, it contains the details of the occlusion study.
  - Explainability_Planning_Investigation.ipynb is about the local and global explainability of the Planning Investigation skill.

- Mixedeffect Models folder contains another two folders.
    - Preprocessing Scripts: This folder contains three python file. These files are used to preprocess the predictions files for the mixed effect models.
    - Rscripts:This folder contains five Rscripts for different mixed effect models.

- Predictive Accuracy folder contains five jupyter files.
    - File name starts with AFLEK contains the instance and entailment based finetuning for six models for each skill. The file name also contains the respective skill names. Furthermore, each files are self contained  for preprocessing and further finetuning.
    - File name starts with CREG contains the instance and entailment based finetuning for six models for binary and four class classification.
